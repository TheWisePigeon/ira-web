	<h1>
		IRA is a tool that helps you replicate your dev environment accross many devices, easily by just
		creating a config file
	</h1>
	<h1>
		I made it after all my developer friends randomly decided to switch to neovim and since I was
		the Neovim "veteran", I had to help then download, install and configure it on their devices, in
		total we did it like 6 times that day, 2 times on windows, 2 times on wsl and 2 times on ubuntu.
		I wrote the tool when I got home that night
	</h1>
	<h1 class=" font-bold">
		IRA means "anger" in latin, and I was pretty pissed off while I was writting it, so that's where
		the name came from :)
